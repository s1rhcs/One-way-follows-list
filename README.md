# One Way Follows

This is a simple, private tool that shows who you follow on Instagram that **don’t** follow you back.

You just open a web page, pick two files from your computer, and it shows you a list. You do **not** need to know anything about coding.

---

## What this tool does (in plain English)

- You download a copy of your Instagram data from Instagram.
- Inside that download are two files:
  - One with people who **follow you**.
  - One with people you are **following**.
- This tool compares those two lists and shows you:
  - People you follow
  - Who **do not** follow you back.

Everything stays on **your** computer. Nothing gets sent anywhere.

---

## Before you start

You will need:

- An Instagram account.
- A computer (Mac or Windows).
- A web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
- A little time to:
  - Download your data from Instagram.
  - Find two files called something like:
    - `followers_1.json`
    - `following.json` (or `following_1.json`)

---

## Step 1 – Download your Instagram data

1. Open your browser and go to **instagram.com**.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Go to your **Settings**.
4. Find **Accounts Center**.
5. In Accounts Center, look for **Your information and permissions**.
6. Click **Download your information**.
7. Choose:
   - All your information (or at least “Followers and following”).
   - **Format: JSON**.
8. Confirm and request the download.

Instagram will prepare your data and send you an email with a download link. This can take a few minutes.

9. When you get the email from Instagram:
   - Click the link in the email.
   - Download the **ZIP file** to your computer (it often goes into the **Downloads** folder).

---

## Step 2 – Find the two important files

1. On your computer, open your **Downloads** folder (or wherever the ZIP was saved).
2. Find the Instagram ZIP file you just downloaded.
3. Double‑click the ZIP file to open or extract it.
4. You’ll see a new folder. Open that folder.
5. Inside, there will be more folders. Keep opening them until you find something like:

   - A folder named `connections`.
   - Inside that, a folder named `followers_and_following`.

6. In there, look for files named similar to:

   - `followers_1.json`
   - `following.json`  
     (If you see `following_1.json` instead, that’s okay too.)

7. Remember where these files are. You will need to select them in the tool.

---

## Step 3 – Open the tool

There are two common ways you might have this tool:

### Option A – You have a link

If someone sent you a link (a website address):

1. Click the link.
2. It will open in your browser.
3. You should see a page that says **Fake ass fucks** at the top.
4. Skip to **Step 4**.

### Option B – You have a file on your computer

If you have an HTML file (for example, `index.html` or `new_following.html`):

1. Find that file on your computer (maybe in Downloads or on your Desktop).
2. Double‑click the file.
3. It should open in your browser.
4. You should see:
   - A title: “Fake ass fucks”.
   - A box asking you to upload your JSON files.
   - A button that says **Build fake ass list** (it might be greyed out at first).

You do **not** need any special program. Just a normal web browser.

---

## Step 4 – Upload your Instagram files (Mac and Windows)

These steps are the same on Mac and Windows. The screens might look a bit different, but the idea is the same.

On the page:

1. Look for the section that says **Upload your JSON files**.
2. Click the rounded **Choose files** button.

A file picker window will open (this is the normal “Open file” window your computer shows).

3. In that window:
   - Go to the folder where you found:
     - `followers_1.json`
     - `following.json` (or `following_1.json`)
4. First, select **one** file:
   - Click on `followers_1.json`.
   - Click **Open**.

Back on the page:

- You will see a little pill next to “followers_1.json”.
- It will change from `(waiting)` to **Uploaded** in green when it has finished reading that file.

5. Click the **Choose files** button again.
6. This time, select the **other** file:
   - `following.json` or `following_1.json`.
   - Click **Open**.

Back on the page again:

- The pill next to “following.json” will also change to **Uploaded** in green when it is ready.

Once **both** pills say **Uploaded**:

- The **Build fake ass list** button will turn on (it won’t be greyed out anymore).

7. Click **Build fake ass list**.

---

## Step 5 – Reading your list

After you click **Build fake ass list**, the view changes.

You will see:

- A number that tells you how many people don’t follow you back.
- A table (a list with rows).

Each row shows:

- The Instagram username.
- The date and time you followed them (if that information exists).
- Buttons and links you can use.

What you can do here:

- **Search**  
  At the top, there is a search box. Type a username to filter the list.

- **Open profile**  
  Next to each username is an **Open** link. Click it to open their Instagram profile in a new tab.

- **Copy profile link**  
  There is also a **Copy** button.  
  Clicking this will copy that person’s Instagram link.  
  You can paste it into messages, notes, etc.

- **Tag people**  
  On the right, you’ll see buttons like:
  - **Unfollowed** – if you already unfollowed them.
  - **Influencer/Celeb** – big accounts or celebrities you don’t mind not following you back.
  - **Public page** – brands, companies, fan pages, etc.

These tags are just for your own organization inside this page. They don’t talk to Instagram.

- **Progress bar**  
  As you tag people, a small progress bar and some numbers update, so you can see how many you’ve gone through.

---

## Privacy and safety (very important)

- Your Instagram files never leave your computer.
- The page only reads the files inside your browser to show you the list.
- The page does **not**:
  - Log in to your Instagram.
  - Send data to a server.
  - Save files or install anything on your machine.

If you are done:

- Just close the browser tab.
- If you open the page again later, you will need to upload the files again.

---

## If something doesn’t work

Here are some simple things to check:

- Make sure you picked the **correct files**:
  - One file with “followers” in the name (like `followers_1.json`).
  - One file with “following” in the name (like `following.json` or `following_1.json`).
- If the page shows an error:
  1. Close the tab.
  2. Open the page again.
  3. Repeat the upload steps.

If Instagram changes how their download works in the future, the file names or folders might look slightly different, but you are still looking for the JSON files related to your followers and following.

---

You don’t need to know how to code to use any of this. Just:

1. Download your data from Instagram.  
2. Find the two JSON files (followers and following).  
3. Open the page and upload them.  
4. Click **Build fake ass list** and explore the results.
